Sam Abraham will show us what MEF is and how to implement it in our own applications.  Also, Dave Nicolas will be back again to show us the basics of jQuery and how we should be using it.  If you’ve ever wanted to create applications that can uses plug-ins or wanted get to know jQuery a bit better then you don’t want to miss this interactive gathering of the dotNet Miami community.</p><p>We will also be giving away more books, swag, and another one-month subscription to PluralSight.</p>" ,
